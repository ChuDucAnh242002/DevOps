LLM tool: chat GPT 4.0

Motivation/reason to use LLM: I would like LLM to explain to me
how docker works and how docker command line such as docker-compose up 
and docker composes down works. I asked LLM to provide examples of Docker files,
examples of how service1 connect with service2, different methods
of getting running processes, and how to check what is shared between
containers and the host.

How and why LLM helped: LLM explains to me and helps me understand
the concept by providing simple contexts and simple examples.
LLM also helps me summarize which code I should consider to use,
provides me with a starting point for me to read more documentation.

Mistakes LLM did: LLM didn't actually understand the actual context
that I faced. For example, I tried to get the ip_address, running_process,
disk_space, and uptime but it provided code which doesn't work. 
After trying multiple methods, I finally found which methods to
get that information.

LLM wasn't able to explain why my command (ps) wasn't recognized
in nodejs when I tried to execute that one. Also, it can't explain
why asynchronous code doesn't run one after another without using 
any kind of delay method.
